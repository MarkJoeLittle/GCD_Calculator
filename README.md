# GCD_Calculator
A greatest common denominator (GCD) calculator for an FPGA using verilog
This is a GCD calculator developed for a Xilinx Spartan vitex 5 FGPA. This project utilizes a datapath and a controller on a 13 state finite state machine design. 
The design is a synthesizable FSM and datapath which computes the GCD of two 4-bit numbers and utilizes the board's reset to clear values after every computation.
